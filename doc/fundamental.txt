1. App Components
    Activitis
    Services
    Content providers
    Broadcast receivers

2. Activating Components
    1) You can start an activity (or give it something new to do) by passing an Intent to startActivity() or startActivityForResult() (when you want the activity to return a result).
    2) You can start a service (or give new instructions to an ongoing service) by passing an Intent to startService(). Or you can bind to the service by passing an Intent to bindService().
    3) You can initiate a broadcast by passing an Intent to methods like sendBroadcast(), sendOrderedBroadcast(), or sendStickyBroadcast().
    4) You can perform a query to a content provider by calling query() on a ContentResolver.

3. The Manifest File
    1) Declaring components
        You must declare all app components this way:

            <activity> elements for activities
            <service> elements for services
            <receiver> elements for broadcast receivers
            <provider> elements for content providers

    2) Declaring component capabilities
        The way the system identifies the components that can respond to an intent is by comparing the intent received to the intent filters provided in the manifest file of other apps on the device.

    3) Declaring app requirements
